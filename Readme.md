# WsjtxUtilsPatch

Just applied some patches to WsjtxUtils to make it compatible with jtdx.

**Note: Although most APIs stay same with WsjtxUtils, It is still not recommended to reference this NuGet package in your project. This package has been customized for use in other projects and may not meet your requirements. Additionally, this package cannot be found via NuGet search and can only be downloaded by explicitly specifying the package name and version.**
